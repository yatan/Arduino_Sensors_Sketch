//**THIS CODE WILL WORK ON ANY ARDUINO**
//This code was written to be easy to understand.
//Modify this code as you see fit.
//This code will output data to the Arduino serial monitor.

//An Arduino UNO was used to test this code.
//This code was written in the Arduino 1.8.5 IDE
//This code was last tested 1/2018
